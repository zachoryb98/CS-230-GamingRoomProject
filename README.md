# CS230-Project
This project includes my course work from CS230

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My client The Gaming Room wants to build game software loosely based on a television show called called Win, Lose or Draw. They want us to build a web-based application to cover other operating systems and allow cross-platform games. The game will be played out of a web browser. The game will allow a match to be made with at least two teams that will take turns guessing images that are rendered over time. If the active team does not correctly guess what the image is one of the other teams can steal the point.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think what I did well on in this was the domain model section. I initially missed this but when I added it I feel I provided a descriptive explanation of the UML Diagram that was provided so that way someone who was maybe not so familiar with software development could understand. I also think I did a great job of building off of feedback provided by my professor, I think after many revisions I finally got it to a point that I was comfortable with.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
One of the most important parts was having the requirements defined. Having those defined early and understanding the Entity relationship of the UML was very helpful when designing the code since we had something that we could visually understand and follow while writing it.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
In the recommendations section I would have liked to have gotten more detailed with security tools, and software we could use. I was able to get more detailed as I started this part early but had some life events that made it more of a time crunch. I would go into more detail about things like active directory and other tools.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by adding visuals and explanations of what everything was and would be doing for us. This would allow for someone who is more business savvy to understand, it acts as a translator between tech and business people. It is important to consuder the user's needs so you can accurately provide and please them with the finished product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I followed the provided tutorials and did a little extra reading on the programming topics, combine those tasks and I was able to tackle the software design. In the future I would consider using maven and dropwizard to create a client server architecture to allow API calls to be made and allow people to browse a public website. I would definitely include UML and a software design document to help build this software.
